This is the README file for our CMPT 276 project, called Pick My Course. Pick My Course helps Simon Fraser University students to select their upcoming schedules based on course diffculty, professor rating, and course load. The aim of our project is to help SFU students be more efficient in their course selection, while also reducing the time spent waiting for an academic advising appointment.

To test our code: 

When creating your database using phpmyadmin, please call it LoginSystem. This way it will work with our configuration.php file.

Inside the database: 
1. Create a table called users. 
2. These are the columns we used for the table. Please name your columns the same. Column names are as follow:     username     id     email     password     major     create_datetime. 


Running Login In and Create Account:

Once a localhost is set up on your computer follow these steps:

1. Open login.html
2. 
    a) If you already have an existing account, please use your login credentials. Please press the "login" button.
    b) If there is not login password, create your account by clicking the "Create New Account" button. Enter the information requested, and click "Create An Account". This will redirect you to the login page. Please enter your login credentials, and press the "login" button.
        Please note: at this point in time, you are able to make 2 different profiles with 1 email. This issue will be looked after in iteration 2.
