Requirement Document Iteration 2


Pick My Course is designed to help Simon Fraser University students to choose their courses for the upcoming semester based on gpa, previous courses taken, course load, course difficulty and on professor ratings from Rate My Professor. Each student will have an account where they can register and login, and save their information such as major and past grades. Pick My Course will reduce waiting for appointments with academic advisors and help students to efficiently and wisely choose their courses.
